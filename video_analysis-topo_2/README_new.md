## How to start a sample run

**Note** : I'm assuming that all commands are executed in the project's root directory

1. Place video files in some directory. `~/Videos` would be fine
2. Write an input file according to the convention mentioned in  `sample_files/exp_cases_backup`
3. Run the experiment with the following string
    `./run.sh <experiment number> 0`
    This generates 
    * The topology
    * The traffic generating script
    * The `tc` on the links
4. After executing `run.sh`, a Mininet console should open up. In the Mininet console, enter the command to start generating traffic
    `source str_scr_new`
5. This will generate
    * received video files in mp4 format
    * `tcpdump` files from sender and receiver in pcap format
    * buffer occupancy stat file in txt format
